# PWA Icon Requirements

You need to create the following icon files in the `/public` directory:

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-384x384.png** - 384x384 pixels
3. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an online PWA icon generator

- Visit https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload your logo/icon
- Download the generated icons
- Place them in the `/public` folder

### Option 2: Manual creation

- Create a square logo image (at least 512x512px)
- Use an image editor to resize to 192x192, 384x384, and 512x512
- Export as PNG with transparency if needed
- Save files to `/public` folder

## Icon Design Tips:

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure it looks good at small sizes
- Consider using a solid background color (#09090b to match theme)
- Center your logo with some padding
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
