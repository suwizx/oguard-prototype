- Display mode: Standalone (full-screen app experience)
- Theme color: `#09090b` (matching your app's dark theme)
- Orientation: Portrait (mobile-optimized)

### 3. **App Icons**

Created three PWA icon sizes from your existing favicon:

- ✅ `icon-512x512.png`

### 4. **Offline Support**

### 5. **Metadata Updates**

Updated `app/layout.tsx` with:

- ✅ Manifest link
- ✅ Theme color for mobile browsers
- ✅ Apple Web App capabilities
- ✅ Viewport settings for mobile optimization

## 📱 How to Test

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):

1. Run `bun run build && bun run start`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Look for the install icon (⊕) in the address bar
4. Click to install as desktop app

### On Mobile (Android):

1. Deploy your app or use tunneling (ngrok, etc.)
2. Open the app in Chrome
3. Tap the menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"
4. The app will appear as a native app icon

### On Mobile (iOS):

1. Open the app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app will appear on your home screen

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Service Worker Settings:

```typescript
{
  dest: "public",           // SW files generated in /public
  register: true,           // Auto-register service worker
  skipWaiting: true,        // Update SW immediately
  disable: dev mode,        // Disabled in development
  fallbacks: {
    document: "/offline"    // Show offline page when disconnected
  }
}
```

### Development Mode:

- PWA is **disabled** in development for easier debugging
- Service worker only activates in production builds

## 🚀 Deployment

When you deploy, the PWA will automatically:

- Cache static assets for offline use
- Enable "Add to Home Screen" prompts
- Provide app-like experience on mobile
- Load faster with cached resources

## 📂 Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `/next.config.ts` - Added PWA configuration
- ✅ `/app/layout.tsx` - Added PWA metadata
- ✅ `/public/manifest.json` - App manifest
- ✅ `/app/offline/page.tsx` - Offline fallback page
- ✅ `/types/next-pwa.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- ✅ `/public/icon-*.png` - PWA icons (3 files)
- ✅ `/.gitignore` - Ignore generated SW files
- ✅ `/tsconfig.json` - Updated to include types

## 🎉 Benefits

Your app now:

- ✅ **Installable** - Users can add to home screen
- ✅ **Offline-capable** - Works without internet
- ✅ **Fast** - Cached assets load instantly
- ✅ **Engaging** - Full-screen, app-like experience
- ✅ **Mobile-optimized** - Perfect for Thai mobile users

## 📝 Notes

- Service worker files (`sw.js`, `workbox-*.js`) are auto-generated during build
- These files are git-ignored and regenerated on each build
- The PWA works best when deployed with HTTPS
- Consider updating icons with your actual app logo for better branding
